ðŸŽ¯ SCORM/xAPI Implementation Summary
Implemented xAPI (Tin Can API) in Unity for LMS compatibility using a Unity xAPI API wrapper. Configured Learning Record Store (LRS) endpoint: URL: https://cloud.scorm.com/lrs/B0Z9LAVY2B/sandbox/ Authentication: LRS credentials securely stored in Unity scripts (not exposed in build). The system sends xAPI statements to record learner interactions and progress. Tracked verbs: experienced â€“ when the learner launches or views the module. completed â€“ when the learner finishes the activity or training module. answered â€“ when the learner responds to a question or assessment.

Each xAPI statement contains:

Actor â€“ learnerâ€™s unique ID and display name. Verb â€“ the action taken by the learner. Object â€“ the activity, lesson, or module being tracked. Result â€“ includes score, success/failure status, and completion state.

The implementation ensures:

Real-time tracking of learner activity. Data can be viewed and analysed in the SCORM Cloud LRS dashboard. Works in both WebGL and desktop builds when internet access is available.
