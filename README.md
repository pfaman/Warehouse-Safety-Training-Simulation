## ðŸŽ¯ SCORM/xAPI Implementation Summary
- Implemented **XAPI** for LMS compatibility using Unity API wrapper.
- Configured LMS endpoint:
  - URL: `https://cloud.scorm.com/lrs/B0Z9LAVY2B/sandbox/`
  - Credentials stored securely in script.
- Sends SCORM `cmi.core.lesson_status` (`completed` / `incomplete`) and `cmi.core.score.raw`.
- Added **xAPI** tracking for:
  - Verb: `experienced`
  - Verb: `completed`
  - Verb: `answered`
- xAPI statements include:
  - `actor` (user ID, name)
  - `verb` (action taken)
  - `object` (activity/module ID)
  - `result` (score, success status)
